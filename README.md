HECTOR Sensor App
=================

Python scripts written to process darknet sensor data from HECTOR.

This project is being developed as an intelligence component of the HECTOR project.



## Security Intelligence ##

Security is more than just a vulnerability report or a code review. Security intelligence
starts with knowing your environment, then expands as you begin to track actionable data
about vulnerabilities, threats, and the specifics of your environment. Making smart decisions
depends on having good data at your fingertips.

## Real Threat Intelligence ##

If you thought threat intelligence was paying thousands of dollars to a security company so
they could lurk in 4chan IRC channels and tell you that Anonymous is planning to hack your
vertical then you've been mislead. Security intelligence applies the principles of big data
to your organization allowing you to see beyond traditional analysis to make better security
investment decisions.

## About HECTOR ##

HECTOR is an open source initiative sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania School of
Arts & Sciences (SAS). At SAS we are deeply committed to increasing the security posture of
every organization by sharing our security discoveries. We believe that a safer and more
secure internet environment begins with informed security decisions and with sharing
security knowledge with others. We are deeply grateful for all of the contributors to the
software that lies at the heart of the HECTOR platform including other open source projects
like NMAP, OSSEC, and more. How Does it Work?

HECTOR is a powerful, extensible, framework for security intelligence data gathering,
analysis and sharing. HECTOR is based on a stable MySQL database back end with a PHP powered
web accessible interface. HECTOR gathers security data from a number of sources including:

    darknet sensors
    Incident reports from your organization
    OSSEC intrusion detection logs
    NMAP port scans
    Vulnerability detection scans
    Incident reports
    RSS feed imports
    and more...

HECTOR's intuitive web based front-end allows for easy data analysis, scan configuration,
and even incident reporting.
